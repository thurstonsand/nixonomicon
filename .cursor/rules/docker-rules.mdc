globs: nas/stacks/**/*
---
1. docker compose files no longer need a version field; it can just be excluded
2. secrets should be stored in `.env` files
3. this project uses git-crypt, and there is already a `.gitattributes` config that automatically encrypts any `.env` files in the `nas/stacks` folder
